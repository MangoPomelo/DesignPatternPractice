# Design Pattern Practice
This project is a series of implementations based on the book _[Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/store)_ published by [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) 

## How to run this project
Download VSCode and docker, then follow the document _[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)_ to setup environment. Alternatively, you can manually install necessary dependencies by reading devcontainer.json

### Creational Design Patterns

1. Factory Method Pattern
    - Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
1. Abstract Factory Pattern
    - Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
1. Builder Pattern
    - Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
1. Prototype Pattern
    - Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
1. Singleton Pattern
    - Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Structural Design Patterns

1. Adapter Pattern
    - Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
1. Bridge Pattern
    - Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
1. Component Pattern
    - Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
1. Decorator Pattern
    - Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
1. Factory Pattern
    - Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
1. Flyweight Pattern
    - Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
1. Proxy Pattern
    - Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
